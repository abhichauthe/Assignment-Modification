Explanation of Code
HTML Structure: This usually contains the basic layout of the page.
JavaScript: This handles the logic for showing ads, including event listeners that trigger the ad.
Assuming the rewarded ad is triggered by a button click or some event, you’ll need to adjust the JavaScript to make the ad appear immediately. 

please do check the html file in the repository #change.html


Here’s a simplified example:
Removed Button: The button to trigger the ad is removed since we want the ad to show immediately.
JavaScript:
showAd() Function: Defines a function that shows the rewarded ad.
window.onload: Ensures that showAd() is called as soon as the page finishes loading.
